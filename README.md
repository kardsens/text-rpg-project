# RPG v6
Here we are again
Just gave up on v5 code because it looked too messy,
starting from scratch now.

This is *just* a learning project for me to understand OOP and python, its not like an
official thing. Yet.

This project is still under development because I'm lazy,
I'm most likely either on break from completing this or working hard on it.

next thing I intend to work on:
```
> clean up the stuff im reusing from v5 and proceed to actually making the thing
```

last thing I got fully done:
```
> cleaned up game.py
```
